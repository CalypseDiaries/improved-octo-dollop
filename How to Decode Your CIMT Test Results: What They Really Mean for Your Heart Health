If you’ve recently had a carotid intima-media thickness scan, you’re probably staring at your CIMT test results and wondering what they actually mean. The numbers can look confusing. But once you understand them, they can give powerful insight into your heart and blood vessel health—often years before symptoms appear.

Let’s break it down in simple terms.

What Is a CIMT Test?

A CIMT test is a painless ultrasound scan of the carotid arteries in your neck. These arteries supply blood to your brain. The test measures the thickness of the inner layers of the artery wall, called the intima and media.

Why does this matter? Because thicker artery walls often mean early plaque buildup. This can signal a higher risk for heart disease and stroke—even if you feel perfectly fine.

Understanding Your CIMT Test Results

Your CIMT test results usually include a measurement in millimeters (mm). Most reports compare your score to what’s expected for your age and sex.

Here’s how to read them:

Normal or Low Risk
A thinner artery wall that matches or is below the average for your age suggests healthy arteries. This means little to no plaque buildup.

Borderline or Moderate Risk
If your measurement is slightly above average, it may signal early artery changes. This is often the stage where lifestyle changes can make the biggest difference.

High Risk or Abnormal
Higher thickness or visible plaque indicates a greater risk of cardiovascular events. This doesn’t mean a heart attack is imminent, but it does mean action is needed.

What About Plaque Findings?

Some CIMT scans also report plaque presence. Plaque is a mix of fat, calcium, and other substances that stick to artery walls.

Plaque findings are important because:

Plaque increases the risk of stroke and heart attack

Even small plaques can be more concerning than thickness alone

Plaque suggests ongoing artery damage

If plaque is found, your doctor may recommend closer monitoring or more aggressive prevention steps.

Why CIMT Test Results Matter More Than Cholesterol Alone

Many people with “normal” cholesterol still develop heart disease. That’s because cholesterol is just one risk factor.

CIMT testing shows the actual condition of your arteries, not just what’s floating in your blood. This makes it a powerful tool for early detection and personalized prevention.

What To Do After Reviewing Your CIMT Test Results

Your results are not a verdict. They’re a guide.

Depending on your score, your doctor may suggest:

Improving diet and physical activity

Managing blood pressure and blood sugar

Reducing inflammation and stress

Taking medications if needed

Scheduling follow-up scans to track changes

The goal is simple: slow, stop, or even reverse artery damage.

The Bottom Line

Your CIMT test results offer a clear window into your cardiovascular health. They help identify risk early—often before symptoms or major events occur.

Understanding these results empowers you to take control of your heart health today, not years down the road. With the right steps, those numbers can improve—and so can your future.
