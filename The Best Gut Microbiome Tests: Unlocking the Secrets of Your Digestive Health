The human gut is home to trillions of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and other microbes, collectively known as the gut microbiome. These tiny organisms play a crucial role in digestion, immune function, and even mood regulation. Over the past few years, research into the gut microbiome has exploded, revealing its profound impact on our overall health. This has led to an increase in the availability of gut microbiome tests, which allow individuals to assess their gut health and understand the makeup of their microbiota.
